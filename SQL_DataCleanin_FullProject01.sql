Project Summary: Data Cleaning for Company Layoff Dataset

Overview:
In this data-intensive project, I meticulously tackled the complexities of a company's layoff dataset. 
My mission? To ensure data quality, consistency, and reliabilityâ€”essential for informed decision-making. 
Leveraging MySQLWorkbench, I executed complex SQL queries, transforming raw data into a pristine, actionable resource.

Key Focus Areas:

1. Removing Duplicates:
   - Identified and eliminated duplicate records.
   - Ensured data integrity by retaining unique entries.

2. Standardizing the Data:
   - Normalized inconsistent formats (dates, periods, etc.).
   - Applied consistent naming conventions for categorical variables.

3. Handling Null Values or Blank Entries:
   - Strategically addressed missing values
   - Categorized categorical values (e.g., "Unknown" or "Null").
   - Ensured data completeness and accuracy.

4. Trimming Unwanted Columns or Rows:
   - Identified irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Safely dropped unnecessary columns, streamlining the dataset.
   - Removed rows with incomplete or irrelevant information.

Technical Details:
- Database Platform: MySQL workbench
- SQL Techniques Used:
  - `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements
  - `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions
  - `CASE` statements
  - Joins and subqueries 

Impact and Takeaways:
- The cleaned dataset now serves as a reliable foundation for subsequent analyses:
  - Predicting layoff trends
  - Identifying risk factors
  - Assessing workforce dynamics
- By mastering complex SQL queries, I demonstrated my ability to handle real-world data challenges and contribute to data quality improvement.

As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to continue refining my skills and applying them to meaningful projects.
